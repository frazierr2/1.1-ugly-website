        Since 1961, Asbury Hills has been serving all people for Christian birth, growth, and renewal by offering summer camp and retreat group experiences for all ages. The camp covers over 2000 acres of mountains and hills, creeks and waterfalls, and forests and lakes in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Asbury Hills offers age-specific programs for campers from 2nd grade through high school, family camps, and serves retreat groups from 8 to 280.
